Welcome to MarketPlants!
This project was developed for Sistems Analysis, wher the objective was to create a model business that could work in the real life.

So we created MarketPlants, an online marketplace where amy user can buy or sell plants and rate sellers or buyers.

It is a React application, where the user date is stored using HTML Web Storage API, nd deployed on Netlify!
